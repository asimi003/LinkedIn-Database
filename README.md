Description:

A database using SQL, triggers, indexes, and Java to run a semi-decent console GUI.

Requirements:

Since this project was created on a local Windows computer. Some requirements must be met given you are also working on a Windows PC: 
Postgres Server for Windows executable . Download and remember the port number and password if any. If using a different port number than the default (5432), update the Java code.
Postgres JDBC Driver JAR API library . Make sure your IDE reads this as a library.
Make sure the libraries in java/lib are recognized by your IDE.
Change the absolute path data CSV files in load_data.sql
All SQL scripts are located in the sql/src folder. This folder has the create_index, create_tables, create_trigger, and load_data files used to load our data and be able to use it effectively.

All Java source code is located in the java/src folder. The file is convoluted but is documented thoroughly.
